<p>So you might be wondering why I don't know if I had an RSI. According to my doctor and my physical therapist I had&nbsp;tendonosis in the ulnar region of my lower arm. If you don't know, that's on the inside of the arm below the elbow. Tendonosis means a deterioration of tendons. According to the medical staff my condition is typical for spending long hours using a keyboard and mouse and may last for months or even years. Now, about nine months later, I'm still not sure if my pain (that is much more managable at the moment) is related to a medical problem or a psychological reason.</p>
<div class="header"><h2>How it began</h2></div>
<p>It started during the spring last year. At the time I was working at an Agency, doing work for a restaurant and food delivery company. The country had been in lockdown for 2 or 3 weeks by now and, since all revenue for our customer was now coming in through online channels, we had more work to do then ever before. During those weeks I felt increasingly frustrated. I was getting a lot of things done, working more than I probably should have, motivated by the challenge of helping the involved parties through this once in a lifetime crisis.</p>
<p>The trouble started when my company started reducing work hours for other employees at our company. In my country (Switzerland) the government is covering for companies that had lost business because of the crisis. So the chiefs of the company started to send people home, they're salaries to be paid via tax money. From a financial perspective this made sense. From my perspective though this was deeply frustrating. I was working the hardest I had been since joining the company, while other employees enjoyed a multiple month long paid vacation with no downsides.</p>
<p>About one month into the whole ordeal, I started to feel pain in my index finger. I ignored it at first, since feeling a little pain somewhere is quite normal and usually goes away after a few hours or days. Not this time though. After ignoring the pain for about two weeks, I scheduled an appointment at my doctor. From what I remember my primary complaint was pain in the index finger and around my elbow.</p>
<p>The doctor sent me home with a doctors note to stay at home for a week, gave me anti inflamatory medication and scheduled a followup appointment.</p>
