I know I did.\"}},{\"id\":\"89j5Gh_TNj\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"A different way to describe Flutter is that it enables&nbsp;<a href=\\\"https:\/\/dart.dev\/\\\">Dart<\/a>&nbsp;to be used as a scripting language with an interpreter for different platforms. That means you're still talking to the same APIs as with any native App. In fact if you want to interface with any device capabilities, beyond showing UI and making HTTP requests, you will need to write the native code for those features.\"}},{\"id\":\"vocNMYg-CV\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"The advantage to using Flutter is the fact that <a href=\\\"https:\/\/pub.dev\/\\\">pub.dev<\/a>&nbsp;provides a repository of packages that enable those native implementations for you, by the community.\"}},{\"id\":\"WWzQsJ9klc\",\"type\":\"header\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"The Dart language is very strictly typed\",\"level\":2}},{\"id\":\"StAtbVaiR3\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"I love strictly typed languages, so for me Dart feels like home.

The Text Input has a property to achieve just that.&nbsp;Doing the same for a dropdown list is completely different. That element does not have the property in question.

Any Widget (roughly equal to a component) can have it's own state, or be stateless. It's easy to forget the lessions learned from <a href=\\\"https:\/\/redux.js.org\/\\\">Redux<\/a>&nbsp;or <a href=\\\"https:\/\/vuex.vuejs.org\/\\\">Vuex<\/a>. Having each component remember it's own state can easily devolve into a complex web of interconnected state changes, making the application hard to understand and debug.\"}},{\"id\":\"aSm-TtHfW0\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"Instead you should try and keep a master record&nbsp;\u2014 a source of truth&nbsp;\u2014 somewhere near the top of the structure.

That's only half true. Some Widgets can be styled globally, without additional parameters. For others (<i>Text,&nbsp;<\/i>for example) their style needs to be set as a property every time.

For my app I was testing on Android and everything was working fine. Out of curiosity I checked the source repository and found out that the iOS implementation is basically a no-op. Sure, the version number 0.0.1 also could have given me a hint, but let that be a lesson to all of us. Make sure your dependencies work well on all your target platforms, before you go all in on them.\"}},{\"id\":\"-qvn3rTYhm\",\"type\":\"header\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"The hot reloading is amazing\",\"level\":2}},{\"id\":\"SrbORpD3n2\",\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"data\":{\"text\":\"This is, in my opinion, the best feature of the bunch. Saving your changes and seeing your changes in under a second rivals the feedback loop for JavaScript applications.
